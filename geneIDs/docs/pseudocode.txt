## *.createGeneLists.sh
1. Download 1ry datasets 
   & curate "current master" & "history tracking" files (for NCBI and Ensembl)
2. Generate maps of gene IDs to symbols
3. Generate lists of gene symbols
4. Basic QC check
5. Basic statistics
6. check for repeated symbols within the same gene record 
7. Tracking of replaced IDs


## *.assessAmbiguity.sh
1. Identify shared genes between every two possible groups
2. Calc rate of ambiguity "*.ambiguous_freq.txt" & prep DB of ambiguous gene symbols

## exploreMasterFiles.sh
1. generate some stats about "current master" files

## crossRef.sh
1. Simplify the master file & generate some stats
2. Generate 3 pairwise maps from each catalog
3. count one-to-many relationships
4. extract one-to-many records 
5. identify cross reference inconsistency for each pairwise map
6. identify Pairwise discrepancies between each pair of databases
7. cross-referencing to discontinued ID
